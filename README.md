# bellybutton-biodiversity
Plotly and the things that live in your bellybutton

The "read-me" for this project is on the webpage itself, and doesn't actually contain much as to the writing and creation of this project as no true "read-me" or report is required. It was difficult, and I learned a lot. JavaScript is the language I struggle with most thus far, and hand in hand with that came extra challenges as to the creation and finalization of this work. While I'm sure it will be welcomed later for the learning it has provided, in the moment I am admittedly frustrated that it isn't as easy to grasp as I was hoping.

On to the next.
