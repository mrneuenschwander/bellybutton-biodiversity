# bellybutton-biodiversity
Plotly and the things that live in your bellybutton

The "read-me" for this project is on the webpage itself (with a copy below for ease of access), and doesn't actually contain much as to the writing and creation of this project as no true "read-me" or report is required. It was difficult, and I learned a lot. JavaScript is the language I struggle with most thus far, and hand in hand with that came extra challenges as to the creation and finalization of this work. While I'm sure it will be welcomed later for the learning it has provided, in the moment I am admittedly frustrated that it isn't as easy to grasp as I was hoping.

On to the next.

### Begin Transcription

This page is intended to show in visual and easy-to-read form the diversity of bacterias present within the bellybuttons of a set of anonymized individuals.

Use the Test Subject ID Number box to select a sample, and the charts will update automatically. To see the data for a given chart or graph, just hover over the desired selection with your mouse, and a text box will appear with information about strains found in that sample! Depending on which sample ID you look at, one may find that a sample (such as #940) shows a more diverse bacterial environment, as opposed to one like #1577 which presents two very dominant strains with the rest lagging behind.
